      <description>The inspiration of hit the gap originates from years ago, when I was just a little kid. Back before when your imagination was a much larger part of your daily entertainment.
Having nothing to do in the car, I&amp;rsquo;d try and judge when my car would line up in between things, cars, trees, road lights, that kind of thing, and when I thought I was right in between I&amp;rsquo;d click my teeth together.</description>
